# Dir_Maker
This is a program that creates nested folders. They are nested only two levels deep.

# Getting Started
To use it you just need to clone the repository.
Change the path variable in main.py to the path you need.
Format your list to contain the subfolders first then their top level folder next    [Sub_Foler], [Top_Level]
Then move it in and change the name for the csv to be openend. 
This should create the folders from there in the proper order.
For an example you can run it as is just change the path to a test folder you make.

# What I learned
I got to read over the os library documentation and what it can be used for.

# Reason
The reason I made this was to automate the process of creating nested folders for a very large list.
